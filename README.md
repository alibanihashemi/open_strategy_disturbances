# Open Strategy Simulation Study

**A deep dive into the effectiveness of stakeholder inclusion in strategy-making processes.**

## Abstract

Open Strategy is a novel strategy-making approach emphasizing stakeholder inclusion. We've conducted a simulation study to explore its long-term effectiveness. Key variables include strategic task complexity, participant numbers, and alignment of objectives.

## Highlights

- **Initial Superiority:** Open Strategy initially outperforms closed strategy-making.
- **Long-term Concerns:** Over time, its efficacy may decline if participant objectives diverge from organizational aims.
- **Optimal Conditions:** Open Strategy is most effective with many participants and low complexity.

## Sections

- **Introduction:** Evolution of strategy-making and the rise of Open Strategy.
- **Methods:** Detailed breakdown of the simulation study.
- **Results:** Outcomes and findings from our research.
- **Discussion:** Implications, potential reasons, and a deeper understanding of results.
- **Conclusion:** Final thoughts and future research directions.
